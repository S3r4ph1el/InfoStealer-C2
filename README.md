This repository presents an infostealer malware project with Command & Control (C2) infrastructure, developed for educational purposes in the **CyberSecurity Fundamentals** discipline at **UnB 2025.1**.

## üéØ Project Objective

The main objective is to develop and implement a laboratory environment for simulating a cyberattack focused on **credential and sensitive data theft via Infostealer**, and maintaining **persistence through a C2 infrastructure**. The simulation aims to understand the dynamics of such attacks and propose **comprehensive solutions** (technical, operational, and procedural) for their detection, prevention, and mitigation.

This work was developed as part of the **CyberSecurity Fundamentals Seminar at UnB 2025.1**.

## ‚ú® Features

The project simulates a multi-stage attack, including the following key components:

* **HID Device Infection Vector (Simulated BadUSB):**
    * Simulates a USB drive that emulates a keyboard (BadUSB) to inject initial commands into the victim machine.
    * Injects commands to download and execute the Infostealer autonomously on the target machine.
* **Infostealer (Malicious Client):**
    * Developed in **Python** for multi-platform compatibility (Linux demonstrated).
    * Collects browser credentials (**Firefox**, **Chromium**).
    * Collects sensitive files (**.bash_history**, **SSH keys**).
    * Searches for **.txt** files containing keywords in their names.
    * Collects system information.
    * Exfiltrates complete files and collected information to the C2 via **HTTP POST**.
* **Command & Control (C2 Server):**
    * Implemented in **Flask (Python)**.
    * Receives and stores exfiltrated data, organized by victim ID and category.
    * Serves the `stealer_client.py` payload for download.
    * Allows the operator to send arbitrary commands to the Infostealer client, receiving the output.
    * Maintains client persistence.

## üõ°Ô∏è Detection and Mitigation Strategies

The project emphasizes proposing comprehensive solutions for detecting, preventing, and mitigating the simulated attack.

* **Technical Controls:** Firewall, EDR/Antivirus, OS hardening, log monitoring, network traffic analysis (IDS/IPS).
* **Operational Measures:** Incident Response Plan (IRP), threat hunting, backups.
* **Procedural Measures:** User awareness regarding social engineering and secure USB usage, USB device usage policies, principle of least privilege.
